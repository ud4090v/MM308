How the Material Group Prediction Engine Works
üîç Smart Auto-Categorization for Inventory Items
Imagine a librarian who instantly knows exactly where to file any book description you give her. This system does the same for material descriptions, using 3 layers of intelligence to pick the perfect category in milliseconds.
Complete Step-by-Step Process
1. Input Processing (tokenArr.js) - "Clean & Extract Key Words"
textInput: "Stainless Steel Pipe Fittings - 2 inch"

Step 1: Split on non-word characters (spaces, hyphens, punctuation)
‚Üí ["stainless", "steel", "pipe", "fittings", "2", "inch"]

Step 2: Remove noise:
‚úÖ Keep: words > 1 character
‚ùå Skip: stop words ["a","the","this","is","was","what","which","there","where","that","and","or","when","then","than"]
‚ùå Skip: numbers like "2"

Final tokens: ["stainless", "steel", "pipe", "fittings", "inch"]

2. Find Candidate Categories
textSearch database for material groups containing ANY of your tokens
Input tokens: ["stainless", "steel", "pipe", "fittings", "inch"]

Candidates found:
‚Ä¢ PIPES (contains "pipe")
‚Ä¢ PIPE FITTINGS (contains "pipe", "fittings")  
‚Ä¢ STAINLESS STEEL (contains "stainless", "steel")
‚Ä¢ METALS (contains "steel")

3. Load Smart Memory Bank (getTensors)
textFor your tokens, fetch proven associations from 32,000+ historical patterns:

"stainless" ‚Üí STAINLESS STEEL (0.94)  
"steel" ‚Üí METALS (0.89), STAINLESS STEEL (0.87)
"pipe" ‚Üí PIPES (0.96), PIPE FITTINGS (0.91)
"fittings" ‚Üí PIPE FITTINGS (0.93)
"inch" ‚Üí PIPES (0.12) ‚Üê Low confidence

4. Genius Scoring System (_mapString)
textFor each candidate, calculate TOTAL SCORE:

PIPE FITTINGS category:
‚úÖ Exact match bonus? No = 0 pts
‚úÖ Keyword matches: "pipe" + "fittings" = +4 pts  
‚úÖ Memory bank: 0.91 + 0.93 = +1.84 pts
‚úÖ Grammar fix: "fittings" ‚Üí "fitting" also matches = +2 pts
TOTAL: 7.84 pts ü•á

PIPES category:
‚úÖ Keyword matches: "pipe" = +2 pts
‚úÖ Memory bank: 0.96 = +0.96 pts  
‚úÖ Grammar fix: "pipes" ‚Üí "pipe" matches = +2 pts
TOTAL: 4.96 pts ü•à

5. Smart Grammar Handling
textHandles plural/singular automatically:
"pipe fittings" ‚Üí matches "Pipes" or "Pipe Fittings"
"stainless steel tubes" ‚Üí matches "Stainless Steel Tube"

Step-by-Step Explanation of How It Works

Prepare the Input Description:

The method starts with your input string (the material description, e.g., "red plastic chair").
It breaks this string into smaller pieces called "tokens." These are basically individual words or key parts of the phrase (e.g., "red," "plastic," "chair"). (Note: The code assumes a helper function called tokenArr() does this splitting‚Äîmore on that below.)
It also creates search filters based on these tokens to find related categories.


Search for Similar Material Groups:

Using a database or backend system (via something called an OData model, which is like a structured way to query data), it looks up a list of existing material groups.
It only pulls groups whose descriptions contain at least one of your input tokens (e.g., if your description has "chair," it might find groups like "Furniture" or "Office Seating").
This narrows down the options to relevant candidates.


Fetch Smart Matching Data (from AI/ML):

It calls a backend function named /getTensors with your input tokens and a type indicator ('matkl', short for material group).
"Tensors" here are likely pre-computed values from a machine learning model (like an LLM). They represent learned associations between words and material groups, based on training data. For example, if past data shows "chair" often links to a "Furniture" group with a strength of 0.8, that gets factored in as a bonus score.
This step adds "intelligence" beyond simple keyword matching‚Äîit's like the system remembering patterns from similar descriptions it has seen before.


Simplify Words for Better Matching:

For both your input description and each candidate group's description, it applies a "singularize" function. This converts plural words to their singular form (e.g., "chairs" becomes "chair," "knives" becomes "knife"). This helps catch matches that might otherwise be missed due to grammar differences.


Calculate Match Scores for Each Candidate:

For every potential material group found in Step 2:

It tokenizes the group's description (again, breaking it into words) and adds singular versions for flexibility.
It checks for matches with your input:

Exact full match (e.g., your description exactly equals the group's description) gets a high score (4 points).
Partial matches (e.g., shared words like "plastic" in both) get medium points (2 points per matching token).
It boosts the score using the AI tensors from Step 3‚Äîif there's a learned connection for a token to that group, add extra points (based on the tensor's value).


All these points add up to a total score for how well your description fits that group.


It sorts the results so the highest-scoring matches bubble to the top.


Pick and Return the Best Matches:

The method compiles a list of these scored matches, including the group code (e.g., "MatGrp"), the group's description, your original input, and the score.
If there's an exact or very strong match, it prioritizes that. Otherwise, it goes with the highest score.
The whole process is wrapped in a "promise" (a JavaScript way to handle tasks that take time, like database queries), so it waits for all data to load before delivering the results.



How Accurate or Useful Is This?

It's a hybrid approach: Part simple search (like Googling keywords) and part AI-assisted (using those tensors for smarter guesses). This makes it more reliable than basic keyword matching alone, especially for varied descriptions.
Scores help rank options‚Äîif the top score is low, it might mean no great match, and you could refine the description.
In a real system, this could auto-suggest categories when entering new items, saving time and reducing errors.
